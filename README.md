# Friend Finder



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

By answering 10 survey questions, you will be matched with the most compatible friend that is in our network. The name and photo of the friend will be shown. On the technical side, best match for a friend is calculated by finding the friend with the lowest difference in scores and then sending that friend to the browser as a JSON object.
